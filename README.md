# SoliditySprintV2
Solidity Sprint for Web3ATL 2023.

### Housekeeping

1. Call the `registerTeam(string)` function with the name of your team. BE ADVISED, for many challenges that do not accept an address parameter, you must solve them with the same address you use to register your team. Many of the challenges do accept a parameter for team. In these challenges you must deploy a contract to solve, and should pass the address of your team in order to receive points.

2. Each challenge has been assigned a specific number of points, increasing both in reward but also in difficulty. You can solve them in whatever order you would like.

3. You can interact with the contract however you would like using whatever sites/dev tooling you wish.

4. The winner is the team with the most number of points at the end of the challenge.
